Monday Mornings
Monday Mornings is an interactive fiction game created with Inform 7, where you play as a person who is trying to get ready for work by 8:30 AM. You’ll need to manage your time wisely, get dressed, eat breakfast, and face the challenges of a rushed Monday morning. The game features various interactive objects and time-based mechanics that affect your progress through the day.

Gameplay:
In this game, you will:

Wake up and start your morning routine.

Interact with various objects, such as your smartphone, wardrobe, breakfast, and TV.

Choose what to wear and manage your time accordingly.

Make decisions based on time (e.g., taking too long to scroll on your phone or eat breakfast could cause you to be late for work).

The game ends with one of several outcomes based on how well you manage your time. Will you make it to work on time, or will you be late?

## **Game Mechanics**

### **Time Management**
The time of day is tracked throughout the game. Each action you perform, such as checking your phone or eating breakfast, will increase the time. Make sure to manage your tasks wisely to avoid being late for work!

### **Clothing System**
Choose from:  
- **Pajamas**: Casual clothes to relax at home, but not suitable for the office.  
- **Casual Clothes**: Perfect for a casual day out but not ideal for work.  
- **Formal Clothes**: The best choice for going to the office.

### **Game Endings**
There are several possible endings, determined by your actions:
- **Late to Work**: If you don’t manage your time and tasks well, you will be late for work.  
- **Conquered the Morning** (Casuals or Pajamas): Wearing the wrong clothes leads to a poor start to the day, but at least you got out of bed!  
- **Successfully Made It to Work**: If you wear formal clothes and manage your time well, you’ll be ready for the day ahead.
